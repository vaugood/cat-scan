# Cat Scan

A web scraping library designed to work through a simple `.txt`-based list of URLs.

# Quick Start

## Set Up

1. Install Python Poetry.

    `pip install poetry`

2. Clone this repo.

    `git clone [repo-url]`

3. Change working directory.

    `cd cat-scan`

4. Install dependencies.

    `poetry install`

## URLs File

### urls.txt
```
# This is a comment
https://this-is-a.url/

# Comment as much as you want
https://and-another.url/
http://and-here-is-another.url/
```

Save this file in the same directory as your main python script file.

## Demo

We have built a functional demo as `demo.py`. Simply run it in from this project directory to see it work. Make sure your `urls.txt` file is in the same root directory as this script.
